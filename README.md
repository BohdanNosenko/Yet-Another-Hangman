# Python Hangman Game

Welcome to the Python Hangman Game! This game is my quick implementation of a classic word-guessing game where you have to guess the letters in a hidden word before you run out of 5 lives.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install Python on your machine if it's not already installed.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the game file.
4. Run the game by typing

```python
python main.py.
```

5. The game will prompt you to enter a letter. Type a letter and press Enter to make a guess.
6. If the letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
7. If the letter is not in the hidden word, 1 life will be subtracted.
8. Keep guessing letters until you either solve the word or you run out of lives.
